<p> I wanted a quick website to show my ipython notebooks, make a personal page and show my scientific publications. Therefore, I started with a template with some fancy textblocks and a, to me, complicated menu which dissapeared, expanded and had several options. A simple copy paste and then I was ready to go. However, I did not understand the options and, after not having worked on the website for several years, I could not recover what it was wat I was doing and why.</p>

<p> What follows is a few notes and steps on what I learned and when I learned it to build this website. I do not claim this is the best way of learning a website, but maybe it helps someone to create a similar website if they like this one. In the end I copypasted solutions and examples from other web pages and online forums. Where possible or applicable I tried to put a commented link in the source code to give credits. I few things I do recommend are Stackoverflow and w3schools (which allows to test code in their environment).</p> 



<p>  I find it easier to start with an idea and then see if I can create it. I start with a simple case

    <ul>
        <li> a block on the left with links to different pages 
             (home, science and CV) </li>
        <li> a few blocks on the page to place content </li>
    </ul>

Hence, I used &lt;div&gt; and &lt;a&gt; 
</p>




<p> Now I have different subpages on my web page that link to each other.  The next thing I wanted to do is to create a nice layout and style. Although a lot is possible in html, I noticed that almost all examples refer to a .CSS file. Hence, I did not look too much into doing advanced layout and styling in html and created a .CSS. 

In the CSS file I wanted the following
    <ul>
        <li> A background picture </li>
        <li> Colours and text style for the menu </li>
    </ul>

</p>

<p> The one thing I keep in mind from my experience with coding in Python/C++ is that once I start to create long bits of code, especially repetative code, it is time to look for solutions to simplify. </p>
